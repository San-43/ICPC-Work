# ICPC-Work

A collection of competitive programming solutions written in C++17 and C++20. The repository is organized by contest or topic, making it easy to find reference implementations for specific training sets.

## Directory overview
- `Codeforces/`: General Codeforces problem solutions grouped together.
- `Kattis/`: Submissions for Kattis problems.
- `Binary Search Codeforces Community Course/`: Exercises focused on binary search techniques from the community course.
- `Two Pointers Metod Codeforces Community Course/`: Practice problems emphasizing two-pointer patterns.
- `Sparse Table Codeforces Community Course/`: Tasks that rely on sparse tables for range queries.
- `Dynamic Programming/`: Introductory dynamic programming practice files.
- `JetBrains Youth Coding Club 2025/`: Training sets for the 2025 club sessions, separated by meeting number.
- `ICPC 2025/`: ICPC preparation material, including a `Repechaje/` subset of practice solutions.
- `Mexico Finals 2025/`: Solutions prepared for the 2025 Mexico finals.
- `ANIEI/`: Problem solutions from the ANIEI contest set.

## Usage
All solutions are standalone C++ source files. To build and run one locally, compile it with a C++17 or C++20 compiler. For example:

```bash
g++ -std=gnu++17 -O2 Codeforces/A_Sun.cpp -o sun
./sun < input.txt
```

Feel free to adapt the compile flags to match your judging environment.
